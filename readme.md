Stack used
NestJS (easier for boilerplate code, tests ecc), Postgres and Kysely.

Tests to watch 
I did some exaple tests in app\uploader-api\test\files.e2e-spec.ts (E2E) and app\uploader-api\src\files\files.service.spec.ts (Unit test).

What I hadn't time to do
- I did the best effort to give an example of bit wise file validation but I could add other file types and signatures.
- Files could be scanned by an antivirus service (like virustotal api or something)
